Welcome to my first attempt at a rice! 

### My Design Philosophy
I always found something zen about the aesthetic of the mid-late 2000's adult swim. I wanted to mix that with the aesthetics of apple. Steve Jobs was inspired by the architect and designer Joseph Eichler, the homes were cleanly designed, had windows on walls that spread floor to ceiling; they were not only beautiful, but functional and cheap. The last word on this is funny when talking about apple, but that and the design and style accompanied with Japanese zen inspired apple to make their "look". Soap Box done, I wanted to capture the feeling I got from both adult swim and the zen in the design of apple.
